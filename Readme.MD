### DAPP StarNotary

This decentralized app (DAPP) shall be able to create an ERC-721 based Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of Stars. 
It's possible to create an NFT with the Starname and a corresponding Token ID. Further it's possible to put a star on sale, 
to exchange stars or to lookup the Starname by the TokenId. 
Finally a simple Front-End was created to enable a User-Interaction. A Star name can be created with a chosen ID. And the Starname can be looked up by the ID.
